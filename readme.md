# Dog Party 2.0

## Project Overview
>The goal of this project was to take two different layout examples and create static pages that mirror the color, positioning and structure.  The HTML structure is the same for both pages, and CSS was used to manipulate this structure to mirror the composites. 

## Skills Learned and Utilized
>To complete this project I had to build out a structure in HTML that was flexible detailed enought to allow me to call to its elements in two seperate CSS files.  I attempted to recreate the positioning in each of the composite photos provide, to accomplish this I had to utilize basic CSS syntax to manipulate CSS boxes. I made an effort to keep the code clean and easily digestable.
